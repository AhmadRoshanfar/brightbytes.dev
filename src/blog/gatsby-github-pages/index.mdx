# Deploying a Gatsby Site on GitHub Pages

## Introduction

Hello! This is my first blog post. In this post, I’ll explain how to deploy a site built with Gatsby on GitHub Pages. I'm using GitHub Pages as a host because it's free and easy!


## Step 1: Install `gh-pages`

First, we need to install the `gh-pages` package:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
    npm install gh-pages
  `}
/>

## Step 2: Add a Deploy Script

Add the following deploy script in the `package.json` file:


<CodeViewer
  code={`\
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "start": "gatsby develop -o -H 0.0.0.0",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public -c CNAME"
  },  
`}
/>

## Step 3: Create a `config.js` File

Create a `config.js` file in the root of your project and add the following content:


<CodeViewer
  code={`\
  const config = {
  gatsby: {
    siteUrl: "https://<YOUR_SITE_DOMAIN>",
    gaTrackingId: null,
    trailingSlash: false,
  },
};
  },  
`}
/>

Then, include this file at the top of `gatsby-config.js`:


<CodeViewer
  code={`\
/**
 * @type {import('gatsby').GatsbyConfig}
 */
const config = require("./config");
`}
/>

## Step 4: Configure Domain Settings

Add a CNAME and four A records in your domain DNS settings. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain) for more details.


<CodeViewer
  code={`\
CNAME    www    <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io.

A        @      185.199.108.153
A        @      185.199.109.153
A        @      185.199.110.153
A        @      185.199.111.153
`}
/>

Make sure to delete any other CNAME and A records.

## Step 5: Create a GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub and add your project:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
git init .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>.git
git push -u origin main
`}
/>

Now, go to **Settings → Pages** (in the left bar)→ **Custom Domain**, and enter your domain and ensure **Enforce HTTPS is checked and DNS check successful.**

## Step 6: Deploy Your Site

### Build and Test Locally

Before publishing, build and serve your website in deployment mode to check everything works as you want:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
gatsby build
gatsby serve
`}
/>

### Publish to GitHub Pages

To deploy your site on GitHub Pages, run:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
npm run deploy
`}
/>


## Step 7: Add a Permanent CNAME

To avoid setting the custom domain every time you deploy, create a `static/CNAME` file and add your website domain:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
brightbytes.dev
`}
/>

## Conclusion

That's it! You’ve successfully deployed your Gatsby site to GitHub Pages. Now your site is live and accessible on your custom domain.
