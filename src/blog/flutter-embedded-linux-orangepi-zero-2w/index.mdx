# Getting Started with Flutter on Embedded Linux

Flutter is an open-source framework that lets you build multi-platform applications from a single Dart codebase. While Flutter officially targets mobile, desktop, and web, with [flutter-elinux](https://github.com/sony/flutter-elinux) you can bring Flutter to resource-constrained Embedded Linux devices like the Orange Pi Zero 2W.

<br/>
## 1. SSH into the Orange Pi Zero 2W

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
   # Discover the board's IP on your LAN:
   hostname -I
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

   # SSH in (default credentials):
   ssh orangepi@<BOARD_IP>
   # password: orangepi `}
/>

## 2. Install Dependencies & flutter-elinux

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev unzip curl clang cmake pkg-config git`}
/>

Clone and set up the CLI:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
git clone https://github.com/sony/flutter-elinux.git
sudo mv flutter-elinux /opt/
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/flutter-elinux/bin`}
/>

Verify your device is recognized:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
flutter-elinux devices
# Should list something like “elinux-arm64”.`}
/>


## 3. Create & Test a Sample App on X11

Use X11 for rapid iteration:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
flutter-elinux create sample
cd sample

export XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11
export DISPLAY=:0

flutter-elinux run -d elinux-x11`}
/>

You’ll get hot-reload and desktop-like development.


## 4. Run on the Linux Framebuffer (DRM/GBM)

Bypass X11 to run directly on DRM/KMS:

1. Stop and disable your display manager:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
sudo systemctl stop lightdm
sudo systemctl disable lightdm`}
/>

2. Build for the GBM backend:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
flutter-elinux build elinux --debug --target-backend-type=gbm`}
/>

3. Launch on `/dev/dri/card0`:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
sudo XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-root \\
     FLUTTER_DRM_DEVICE=/dev/dri/card0 \\
     ./build/elinux/arm64/debug/bundle/sample \\
     -b ./build/elinux/arm64/debug/bundle`}
/>

Your Flutter UI should appear fullscreen via DRM/KMS.


## 5. Auto-Start with systemd

Create `/etc/systemd/system/flutter-sample.service`:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
[Unit]
Description=Flutter Sample App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=orangepi
WorkingDirectory=/home/orangepi/sample
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "\\
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/runtime-root \\
  FLUTTER_DRM_DEVICE=/dev/dri/card0 \\
  /home/orangepi/sample/build/elinux/arm64/debug/bundle/sample \\
  -b /home/orangepi/sample/build/elinux/arm64/debug/bundle"
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target`}
/>

Enable and start it:

<CodeViewer
  code={`\
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable flutter-sample.service
sudo systemctl start flutter-sample.service`}
/>

On reboot, your Flutter app will launch directly on the framebuffer.
